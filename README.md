### The Data
For this project we chose to show flight delays for domestic flights in the US in the year 2008.

### How To Run
#### 1. Download the project source code
Either clone the project, or download it manually and extract it.

#### 2. Open a Terminal and run your favorite server
We developed this project using python's server functionality, so for best results we recommend using the same.
```bash
$ cd /path/to/source-code
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer <port>
```

#### 3. Fire up Chrome (yes, please use Chrome)
We kindly ask for you to use Chrome, which is what we used while developing, and where we got the best results. Open it, and navigate to `http://localhost:<port>/`

#### 4. You're all set!
You can now explore the visualization dashboard.
